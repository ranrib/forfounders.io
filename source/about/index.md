We are two entrepreneurs from Tel Aviv whoâ€™ve been working together for almost a decade.

We met in our military service while working on cyber-security projects. In 2017 we started Epsagon together, a startup that helps developers to monitor and troubleshoot their modern cloud applications.

We raised over $30M from Silicon Valley investors like Lightspeed and USVP and grew an international team with an HQ in New York City and R&D center in Tel Aviv. During the last five years, we experienced the startup rollercoaster through product development, go-to-market, executive hiring, fundraising, and eventually, selling Epsagon to Cisco in 2021.

Today, we are product & engineering leaders and Cisco, and in addition - working closely with founders in their early days, trying to help them build the next big startup company.
