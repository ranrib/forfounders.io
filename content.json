{"pages":[{"title":"About Us","text":"We are two entrepreneurs from Tel Aviv whoâ€™ve been working together for almost a decade. We met in our military service while working on cyber-security projects. In 2017 we started Epsagon together, a startup that helps developers to monitor and troubleshoot their modern cloud applications. We raised over $30M from Silicon Valley investors like Lightspeed and USVP and grew an international team with an HQ in New York City and R&amp;D center in Tel Aviv. During the last five years, we experienced the startup rollercoaster through product development, go-to-market, executive hiring, fundraising, and selling Epsagon to Cisco for over $400M. Today, we are product &amp; engineering leaders and Cisco, and in addition - working closely with founders in their early days, trying to help them build the next big startup company.","link":"/about/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"Sales vs. Marketing - Who Should You Hire First?","text":"TBD","link":"/sales-vs-marketing-first-hire/"}],"tags":[{"name":"blog","slug":"blog","link":"/tags/blog/"},{"name":"sales","slug":"sales","link":"/tags/sales/"},{"name":"marketing","slug":"marketing","link":"/tags/marketing/"},{"name":"hiring","slug":"hiring","link":"/tags/hiring/"},{"name":"startups","slug":"startups","link":"/tags/startups/"}],"categories":[]}
