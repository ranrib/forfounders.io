In 2017 we started Epsagon together, a startup that helps developers to monitor and troubleshoot their modern cloud applications. We raised over $30M from Silicon Valley investors like Lightspeed and USVP and grew an international team with an HQ in New York City and R&amp;D center in Tel Aviv. During the last five years, we experienced the startup rollercoaster through product development, go-to-market, executive hiring, fundraising, and eventually, selling Epsagon to Cisco in 2021. Today, we are product &amp; engineering leaders at Cisco, and in addition - working closely with founders in their early days, trying to help them build the next big startup company.","link":"/about/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"How to Start a Startup?","text":"How to Start a Startup?So you want to start a startup. How do you start? Let’s cover the basic steps. Quitting your jobAssuming you are currently working somewhere, you’ll need to quit your job first. But you want to quit your job only when your startup (or startup idea) is mature enough - but how do you get to this maturity if you work a full-time job? That is a classic chicken and egg problem. From our experience, quitting your job is essential; the earlier, the better, for several reasons: As long as you continue only working evenings and weekends on your startup, you’ll be progressing very slowly, so in a way, you’re wasting your own time. Working full time isn’t just 5x more than working 2 hours a day - it’s 100x more. Having this kind of focus will make you so much more efficient. Focusing 24/7 on one problem is the only way to go. If you have co-founders, it’s a great test for their and your commitment. Quitting your job is a risk - the first risk every entrepreneur has to take early on. Not to mention that when you get to the fundraising stage, this is almost a must. Serious investors expect you to show that you are 100% committed to this startup. Finding your co-foundersEveryone talks about co-founders - that person (or people) you will spend the next 5-10 years with, and how important it is to find the right ones. But before thinking about how to find them, you should ask yourself - do I even need them? Not necessarily. Some of the most successful companies had a single founder (Jeff Bezos), so it’s a valid option. However, from our experience, having a partner (and it is a partner!) is highly beneficial, especially in the mental aspects - having someone to go through this journey with you can make all the difference. Therefore, it’s essential to find a co-founder aligned with you - for example, if one of you already quit your job, the other one should too. In any case, everyone seems to agree that it’s crucial to take all the time you need to find the right co-founder. Don’t rush into a decision that doesn’t sit well. The logistics (or - legal stuff)Do you need a founder agreement? Why? How do you get one? It comes down to knowing what you know and don’t know. Get a good lawyer early, someone who knows startups and fundraising. They will help you understand what is essential at this early stage. Regarding a founder’s agreement - yes. It is possible, even expected, that sometimes one of the founders will realize early on that a startup isn’t for them. Whether the reason is financial, personal, or other, it’s essential to have a document that protects the other founder and allows them to continue building the company. IdeationSo you quit your job, have a co-founder, and now you need to start doing something. It may seem impossible, but we can offer some practical tools to find the problem that deserves to be solved. Be methodical! First of all, what is a market where you (or one of the founders) have unique expertise? A startup is complicated, so you shouldn’t add difficulty by choosing a domain you don’t understand very well. Is this a big market? Is it growing fast enough? You want to see exponential growth. If it’s growing fast, you will have the market on your side. It’s not enough, but it’s better than fighting an uphill battle. How do you know your market size? It’s important to distinguish between the domain size (“cloud spending will be $100B in 2022”) vs. your specific market (“companies are spending $10B per year on troubleshooting cloud-native applications”). The latter is far more critical as it represents what you can sell to customers. Do you have a passion for the market? People often feel they need to have a passion for something to work on it. Our experience shows that you need to be careful. As entrepreneurs, we have always had a strong passion for building great businesses, first and foremost. To do this, we needed to raise money. To do that, we needed a market where we are experts, and it is growing fast. Imagine the opposite - would you like to work on an exciting problem, only to stop working on it six months later because you couldn’t raise enough money? Of course, we are exaggerating, but we believe this is an important exercise. Don’t just start buildingDon’t spend too much time on building the actual product. Building an MVP for a B2B product with no resources (=programmers) is very difficult. It can take years. Instead, try to focus on market validation and use mockups to get customer feedback. Then, once you raise your seed round, you can run 10x faster with a kickass core engineering team. Market validationSo you put a lot of thinking and believe that you should solve a problem in a big, growing market, where you have expertise. But this is still only what you think. Now is the time to validate it with the market. This part is relatively straightforward, but most founders struggle with it, or worse - skip it. The bottom line is that you need to speak with many potential customers to validate that they have the problem you think they have, and maybe even what you’d like to build will solve it for them. Assuming you’re a B2B startup, you probably need a few dozen calls with potential customers. Anything goes to get in front of these customers. Use your connections, or reach out to high-targeted leads (such as public speakers or bloggers) via email or LinkedIn. Hassling a bit can be beneficial at this stage. Try to go beyond your network, and bring some familiar logos that the investor will quickly identify. If a cold lead takes the call with you, it proves that your initial messaging to the market works and sparks customer interest. Use “warm-cold intros”: target people you don’t know, but you know a lot about them - “Hi John, I liked your talk about microservices at the AWS conference. Can I ask you a question about it?” It’s also important to know how to ask questions. We recommend the book The Mom Test to ensure you get the most unbiased answer from the customer. For example, a great customer quote is: “we spent a lot of time trying to build an in-house solution, and it didn’t work.” The market validation is the most crucial part of a strong investor’s deck. In the deck, you should have a few slides showing customers you spoke with and highlighted quotes from customers that describe their problems. Ideally, some of these customers are referenceable, so your investor can chat with them. What’s next? Fundraising!In the following episodes, we’ll talk about raising your seed round and how to start building your company!","link":"/how-to-start-a-startup/"},{"title":"Raising Your Seed - Part 1: Preparing for the Round","text":"Raising Your Seed - Part 1: Preparing for the RoundFundraising is one of the fundamental aspects of a startup. But unfortunately, it’s also one of the most challenging areas. So we’ll try to make it simpler here. This blog series will cover the basics of raising your seed round - from getting ready for the round to meeting investors and eventually having money in the bank. Fundraising vs. BootstrappingWhy do even you need to bring outside money? The shortest answer is because almost everything costs money: developers for building your product, travel to present at conferences, office space, and so on. These alone will probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for the first year. So fundraising makes sense. But there is a way not to raise money, as long as you can generate revenue to cover your expenses - this is bootstrapping. If you can start generating revenue, you can use it to cover costs and grow your business. The advantage of bootstrapping is that you’re calling the shots. You and your co-founders are the board. What’s better than that? And there are some fantastic success stories for bootstrapped companies. There are downsides to bootstrapping. The first and most important is speed. You’re operating in a fast-growing, highly competitive market. The first company to conquer the space will be the winner. The others will likely disappear. Raising capital means you can run 10x faster, which could be the difference between a winning and mediocre business. Fundraising allows you to accelerate using money. Bootstrapping also means you have more mental stress since you might need to live with zero or a minimal salary for a longer time. For these reasons, most startups choose to fundraise versus going bootstrapped. The fundraising landscapeThere are different types of investors: Angel investors are private people who usually invest anywhere from $10K to $100K, sometimes more. They often invest in groups, so the total amount is hundreds of thousands. Founders like angels because of their unique expertise and ability to help, sometimes more than their money. “Super angels” are angels that can invest anywhere from hundreds of thousands to $1M-$2M. A Venture Capital (VC) firm invests anywhere from $100K (a small or pre-seed VC) to a more prominent VC that can support anywhere from $1M up to billions in a single round. A corporate VC is an investment arm of a corporation. They aim to invest in startups for financial returns (like a regular VC) or strategic collaboration. Unfortunately, they are usually too early to bring in a seed round. The funding roundsA software B2B company typically needs anywhere from $1M to $5M to get going. The heavier the tech and the sales cycle are, the more it needs. Another way to think about these amounts is by the stage or “round” the company is at: Pre-seed stage: the goal is to verify what the startup wants to build. For that, the company usually needs $500K or less. Then, a successful milestone will be to get the initial technology working or get initial users (usually in a B2C product). Seed stage: the goal is to show initial product-market fit (PMF). In B2B, an ARR (annual recurring revenue) of a few hundreds of thousands or several paying and referencable customers is a good sign of PMF. In B2C, this could mean thousands of users or more. Being ready for the next round means you can start hiring sales and marketing people to start building the commercial operation. The seed round is usually $1M-$5M but can be even $10M in infrastructure companies that are more capital intensive. Series A: building the commercial team and proving the Go-to-Market (GTM) fit, meaning raising an additional $10M-$30M, hiring your first executive team members (e.g., VP of Sales and VP of Marketing), and a small sales team. A successful milestone would be reaching $2M-$5M of ARR. Series B, C, D, and after: from here, it’s about scaling the business to $10M, $30M, and eventually over $100M ARR. A series B usually starts at $20M and can be much more. Also, the terminology usually fades at these stages, and you’ll see very different ranges of numbers. For example, at Epsagon, we raised a $4M seed round in 2018, led by two VCs. Then we raised a $16M Series A in 2020 led by a VC, with multiple angels participating. How valuations workIf your startup’s valuation is $15M, what does it mean? It’s straightforward: the pre-money valuation is the valuation on the day of investment, and post-money is the valuation a moment after raising the round. So: post-money = pre-money + round size. How does that work with dilution? The investor’s ownership is the round size divided by the post-money valuation. So if an investor invests $3M in a company with a pre-money valuation of $12M, they get 20% of the company because three divided by 15 (12+3) is 20%. Most seed-stage VCs want significant ownership in the company, usually 10% or more, sometimes up to 30%-40%, because they know, they might not have another opportunity to invest in the company. However, more prominent VCs can invest in later stages and be more flexible. Since valuation is arbitrary and not based on revenue multipliers, it is mainly a market function and how much you raise. For example, if you ask for $1M, you might be valued at $5M, whereas $5M can make an argument that you are worth $20M. So don’t think of raising less as a way to have less dilution. Optimizing for the right thingsThere are several factors you should think about when fundraising, including: The round size The valuation The duration of the round The VC firm and the person joining your board From our experience, the most critical factor when fundraising is the person you will be working with closely during the next 5-10 years. So when deciding between different options, never choose someone, a person, or a firm that is not a good fit for you. That is always a no-go. However, you might be able to increase the valuation offered by the investor you want by having competing offers, so that’s always a good thing.
